# MinesWeeper Game

This minesweeper game was developed for a project at the last avaliation of the class PTI (Programming Technique Introduction)
on my second semester at IMD/UFRN.
It was all made using C language and structs, functions, recursion, etc.

To compile this program you can use the following command line at the terminal on the folder of the project:

gcc -o output_name_u_want Minesweeper.c
